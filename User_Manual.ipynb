    "Chemical Reaction Rate Simulator (CRRS) is a suite of software for the calculation of chemical kinetics. It can simulate a system consisting of $N$ species undergoing $M$ **irreversible**, **elementary** reactions of the form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime}\\mathcal{S}_{i}} \\longrightarrow \n",
    "  \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime\\prime}\\mathcal{S}_{i}}, \\qquad j = 1, \\ldots, M\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the rate of change of specie $i$ (the reaction rate) can be written as \n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "  f_{i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{M}{\\nu_{ij}\\omega_{j}}, \\qquad i = 1, \\ldots, N\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the progress rate for each reaction is given by \n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\omega_{j} = k_{j}\\prod_{i=1}^{N}{x_{i}^{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime}}}, \\qquad j = 1, \\ldots, M\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $k_{j}$ is the forward reaction rate coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, CRRS can handle $N$ species undergoing $M$ **reversible, elementary** reactions, pulling the necessary coefficients from [the NASA polynomials database](http://combustion.berkeley.edu/gri_mech/data/nasa_plnm.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "These reversible reactions allow the package to calculate reaction rates wherein products can react and produce the reactants. For example:\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime}\\mathcal{S}_{i}}  \\rightleftharpoons \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime\\prime}\\mathcal{S}_{i}} \\qquad j = 1, \\ldots, M$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the progress rate becomes:\n",
    "$$r_{j} = k_{j}^{\\left(f\\right)}\\prod_{i=1}^{N}{x_{i}^{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime}}} - k_{j}^{\\left(b\\right)}\\prod_{i=1}^{N}{x_{i}^{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime\\prime}}}, \\qquad j = 1,\\ldots, M.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this will now require a backwards reaction rate coefficient as well, $k_{j}^{\\left(b\\right)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_{j}^{\\left(b\\right)} = \\frac{k_{j}^{\\left(f\\right)}}{k_{j}^{e}}, \\qquad j =1, \\ldots, M$$\n",
    "where $k_{j}^{e}$ is the *equilibrium coefficient* for reaction $j$, calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_{j}^{e} = \\left(\\frac{p_{0}}{RT}\\right)^{\\gamma_{j}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S_{j}}{R} - \\frac{\\Delta H_{j}}{RT}\\right), \\qquad j =1, \\ldots, M$$\n",
    "where $\\gamma_{j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\nu_{ij}}$ and $p_{0}$ is the pressure of the reactor, assumed to be $10^{5}$ Pa.\n",

    "where $M$ is the mediating third body. In order to deal with $M$, we introduce the notion of **_efficiency_**, $\\epsilon$, to describe how well each of the other species in the reaction exchange energy with the collision partner. With the efficiencies, we can describe the concentration of $M$ as\n",

    "$$ k_f(T)[A][B][M] $$\n",
