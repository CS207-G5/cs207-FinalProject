    "| Symbol | Meaning |\n",
    "|:--------:|:-------:|\n",
    "| $\\mathcal{S}_{i}$ | Chemical symbol of specie $i$ |\n",
    "| $\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime}$ | Stoichiometric coefficients of reactants |\n",

    "In addition, CRRS can handle $N$ species undergoing $M$ **reversible, elementary** reactions, pulling the necessary coefficients from [the NASA polynomials database](http://combustion.berkeley.edu/gri_mech/data/nasa_plnm.html).\n",

    "These reversible reactions allow the package to calculate reaction rates wherein products can react and produce the reactants. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that this will now require a backwards reaction rate coefficient as well, $k_{j}^{\\left(b\\right)}$. \n",

    "$$k_{j}^{\\left(b\\right)} = \\frac{k_{j}^{\\left(f\\right)}}{k_{j}^{e}}, \\qquad j =1, \\ldots, M$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The combination of two reactants into a single product which is a combination of both requires a third body to mediate the reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A + B + M \\to AB + M $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M$ is the mediating third body. In order to deal with $M$, we introduce the notion of **_efficiency_**, $\\epsilon$, to describe how well each of the other species in the reaction exchange energy with the collision partner. With the efficiencies, we can describe the concentration of $M$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ [M] = \\sum_i \\epsilon_i C_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C_i$ is the concentration of the $i$th specie. We can then write the forward reaction rate as\n",

    "$$ k_f(T)[A][B][M] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_f(T)$ is the forward reaction rate coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This forward reaction rate coefficient can be written in a couple different ways. In the *Lindemann form*, it can be written as\n",

    "$$k_f(T, [M]) = \\frac{k_0[M]}{1 + \\frac{k_0[M]}{k_\\infty}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_0[M]$ is the low-pressure limit of the reaction rate coefficient and $k_\\infty$ is the high-pressure limit.\n",

    "Defining the *non-dimensional reduced pressure* as $P_r \\equiv \\frac{k_0[M]}{k_\\infty}$, we can rewrite this expression as $k_f(T, P_r) = \\frac{k_\\infty P_r}{1 + P_r}$. With this, we can write more specific forms of the forward reaction rate as\n",

    "$$k_f(T, P_r) = \\frac{k_\\infty P_r}{1 + P_r} F(T, P_r) $$\n",

    "#### New modules and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the following should go into their own class `NonelementaryRxn()`, which should fit neatly into `chemkin.py` and be a subclass of the other classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implementing this new type of reaction involves new reaction parameters (efficiencies, low and high limits of reaction rate coefficients, etc.). These will have to be parsed from input `.xml` files, thus our parsing functions will have to change or be reimplemented in a new nonelementary reactions class.\n",
    "* We will need a new subclass `reaction_rate() `method. This will involve computing the concentration of $M$.\n",
    "* We will need a new method to compute the Lindemann form, at the very least. There then should be an option to specify a falloff reaction method which will multiply the form, such as the next point:\n",
    "* We will need a method to compute the Troe falloff function.\n",
    "* Whether or not we allow these reactions to be reversible is up for discussion. If so, we would need to learn more about how a reversible reaction works in the context of a three-body reaction, but this is likely outside the scope of the current proposal..\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use and dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed feature would be used exactly as the elementary reversible and irreversible reactions are used. An initializer would read in a `.xml` file specifying reaction parameters and the user would be provided with a nonelementary reaction object with which they can specify reaction concentrations and temperatures to compute reaction and progress rates.\n",
    "\n",
