### TODO

**Tests should be written as these are being completed**:
* Update the parser (just change Arrhenius to ModifiedArrhenius and do the new
  three-body stuff) - Thomas
* New reaction rates method which will include computation of [M] - Yujiao
* Compute the Lindemann form which should be a function: should take a falloff
  reaction method as an optional parameter - Brianna
* Compute one such falloff reaction: Troe falloff function - Brianna
* Examples directory so that we can both present it for the final and also allow
  the user to reproduce an example
* Documentation - Zhai
