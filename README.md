### TODO
* On the `classes` branch, integrate data retrieval of .xml files into the new
  class in `chemkin.py`.
  * Have the class return an object that has member methods which can be called
    on just the concentrations alone.
  * Write new tests for all of the above.
  * Update model doc to reflect all of the above (for example, things are going
    to change in the way we run this code, so the *Basic Usage and Examples*
    section will have to change).
