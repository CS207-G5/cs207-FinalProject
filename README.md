### TODO
* Move the contents of `chemkin_rvs.py` into `chemkin.py` under the reversible
  reactions class (preferably, we would have that the class inherit from the
  elementary reactions class so that we don't have redundant code floating
  around).
  * Once this is done, write tests for the reversible reactions class.
* Packaging
* Model Doc
